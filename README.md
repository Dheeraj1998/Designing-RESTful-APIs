# Designing-RESTful-APIs
Course content part of the udacity course on "Designing RESTful APIs".

# Introduction
Web APIs have allowed developers to gain more control over an application leading to much more customizations. An example of a company heavily dependent on APIs is Twilio. Web APIs usually work on the Application layer of the OSI model.

# REST
REST refers to REpresentational State Transfer protocol. It uses HTTP verbs for the management of resources and can use any type of message format. The stateless architecture allows for much more scalability.

# REST constraints
1. The architecture is divided into server-client.
2. The activity is stateless since it does not retain any type of information.
3. The response should be cacheable in case the response has not changed over time.
4. It must have a uniform interface for any kind of information.
5. It must follow a layered type of system in which the client only interacts with the point of contact.
6. Code on demand is an optional constraint in RESTful architecture.
